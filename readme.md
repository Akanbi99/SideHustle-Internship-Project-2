## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This section helped us improve our knowledge of css grid and css flexbox and their properties. It also helped increase our understanding of responsive layout and this will help each and every one of us on future projects.



### Continued development

There's still room  for improvement on our understanding of layouts and use of javascript. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1]Thenetninja(youtube channel) - This broke down css into sizeble and understandable chunks.


## Acknowledgments
